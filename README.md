# PyPoe

A Python chat client that exposes models from **Poe** and **OpenRouter**
through three interfaces — a CLI, a local web UI, and a Slack bot — all sharing
a single SQLite conversation history at `~/.pypoe/single_webchat_history.db`.

Routing is **per model**: each entry in the model catalog names its provider, so
a Poe model and an OpenRouter model can be used side by side, including as the
two sides of a debate. At least one provider key is required; it need not be
Poe. See [Model providers](#model-providers).

## Three interfaces

- **CLI.** Interactive chat from the terminal.

  ```bash
  pypoe cli select          # pick or start a conversation
  pypoe cli chat            # start/continue a chat
  pypoe cli list            # list conversations
  ```

- **Web UI.** Browser chat with a sidebar of past conversations.

  ```bash
  pypoe web                 # http://127.0.0.1:8000
  ```

- **Slack bot.** `/poe` slash command, `@PyPoe` mentions, and DMs, with
  per-thread context.

  ```bash
  pypoe slack
  ```

All three write to and read from the same database, so conversations
started in one interface continue in the others.

### Optional: lab integration

PyPoe also ships a read-only **lab interface layer** for the AC Organic
Self-driving Lab. With `pip install -e ".[lab]"` you additionally get:

- `pypoe lab-mcp` — a read-only MCP server (talk to the lab from
  Claude Desktop / Code).
- `pypoe lab-status` — one-shot aggregator health summary.
- `/lab-*` Slack slash commands (auto-registered on `pypoe slack` when
  `LAB_API_URL` is set).
- `POST /alerts/kuma` + `POST /alerts/device` webhooks (auto-mounted on
  `pypoe web` under the same condition): Uptime Kuma service alerts and
  aggregator-pushed device alerts, both posted to Slack with a threaded
  `claude -p` investigation.
- `GET /kuma/status` — a STATUS_SPEC envelope gateway-fronting Uptime
  Kuma so the lab dashboard can show an alerting-watchdog tile.

The integration is **read-only at the device level**: there is no
`control_action` tool and no `/control/*` calls. Control flows through
the `lab-skills` SDK in `ac-organic-lab/`. See
[docs/LAB_INTEGRATION.md](docs/LAB_INTEGRATION.md) for setup.

## Install

PyPoe is editable-installed from a clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pypoe.git
cd pypoe
pip install -e .                  # CLI only
pip install -e ".[web-ui]"        # CLI + web + Slack
pip install -e ".[dev]"           # everything + test/lint tools
```

The web UI and Slack bot share the same `web-ui` extra (both depend on
`fastapi`, `slack-bolt`, etc.). Image/video auto-download is a separate
`media` extra and requires `PYPOE_ENABLE_MEDIA=true` at runtime.

## Quickstart

1. Get a key from at least one provider — [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
   or [Poe](https://poe.com/api_key).
2. Create a `.env` in the repo root:

   ```env
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
   POE_API_KEY=your-poe-api-key      # optional; only for Poe-routed models
   ```

3. Pick an interface:

   ```bash
   pypoe cli select   # terminal
   pypoe web          # browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000
   pypoe slack        # requires Slack app + SLACK_* env vars
   ```

For network access, authentication, Slack app setup, or running as a
service, see the topic-specific docs below.

## Model providers

The catalog lives in `src/pypoe/config/models.yaml` (gitignored; copy from
`models.example.yaml`). Each entry names its provider — a bare string is a Poe
model, a mapping is anything else:

```yaml
default: z-ai/glm-5.2

chat_models:
  - {id: z-ai/glm-5.2, provider: openrouter}
  - {id: deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-0731, provider: openrouter}
  - Claude-Opus-4.8            # bare string => Poe
```

| Provider | Key | Billing | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `openrouter` | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | **per token** | ~400 models; ids must match [OpenRouter's slugs](https://openrouter.ai/models) exactly |
| `poe` | `POE_API_KEY` | flat subscription | the only provider with image/video generation bots |

A provider with no key configured is skipped: its models report a clear
"not configured" error if selected, and `/status` omits it rather than calling
it unhealthy. The service is healthy as long as **one** provider can answer, so
a lapsed Poe subscription alongside a working OpenRouter key is not an outage.

**Spend guards** (OpenRouter only, since Poe is a flat subscription):

```env
PYPOE_OPENROUTER_MAX_TOKENS=4096   # ceiling on every completion; 0 disables
PYPOE_OPENROUTER_MIN_CREDITS=1.0   # USD below which /status reports degraded
```

`GET /status` carries one component per configured provider (`poe_api`,
`openrouter_api`) with a provider-qualified error code — `poe_subscription_required`,
`openrouter_auth_failed` — plus the remaining OpenRouter balance. Health is
observed from real traffic, with a `max_tokens=1` probe only when that evidence
goes stale.
