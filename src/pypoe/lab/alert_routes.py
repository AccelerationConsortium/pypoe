"""``POST /alerts/kuma`` webhook handler.

Mounted onto PyPoe's existing FastAPI app (``interfaces/web/app.py``).
Receives Uptime Kuma's default JSON payload, posts an instant
"Investigating…" message into Slack, and kicks off a background
OpenRouter investigation (GPT-5.6 Luna) against the in-process lab
tools. The investigation result is appended as a threaded reply.

Concurrency is bounded by a process-wide semaphore so a flood of alerts
