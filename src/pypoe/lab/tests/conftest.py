"""Shared pytest fixtures for ``pypoe.lab`` tests.

Every test runs against a *fresh, empty* lab config so that the host's
real ``slack.yaml`` and ``.env`` don't leak in. Tests that want
non-default values opt in via ``monkeypatch.setenv`` or by writing
their own YAML and pointing ``PYPOE_LAB_CONFIG`` at it.
